heds_types;

% Detect SLMs and open a window on the selected SLM:
heds_slm_init;

% Open the SLM preview window in non-scaled mode:
% This might have an impact on performance, especially in "Capture SLM screen" mode.
% Please adapt the file show_slm_preview.m if preview window is not at the right position or even not visible.
show_slm_preview(1.0);

% Show image file data on SLM:
filename = strcat( fileparts(mfilename('fullpath')), '/data/blazed_grating_45deg.png' )
heds_show_data_fromfile(filename)
